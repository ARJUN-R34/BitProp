# BitProp

## Application of the project

BitProp is a solution to the growing problems of real estate data manipulation and land grabbing by influential and powerful people.
Lack of transparency in the traditional property details storing mechanism coupled with offline storage makes it vulnerable to theft and manipulation.
Using Ethereum Blockchain, both of these problems can be solved thereby restoring the trust of the people back in the system.
